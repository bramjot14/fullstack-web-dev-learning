Completed:
- Created default export and named exports in a separate module
- Imported default and named exports into a React entry file
- Fixed common syntax issues with ES6 imports/exports
- Understood when to call functions vs passing references


Day-5:
###  React Project – Keeper App

Completed:
- Built a simple Keeper notes app using React
- Created and composed reusable components (`Header`, `Note`, `Footer`)
- Practiced JSX rules (single parent element, fragments, return syntax)
- Fixed common React mistakes (component naming, returns, semicolons in JSX)
- Improved understanding of default vs named exports in real project usage
- Applied basic styling using CSS


Day-6:
### React Props & Data Handling – Contacts App

Completed:
- Practiced passing data to components using props
- Created reusable Card component for displaying contact details
- Stored contact data in an external JavaScript array
- Imported and consumed external data files in React
- Accessed object properties from arrays using index notation
- Fixed common props and export/import errors
- Strengthened understanding of component reusability and data flow
- Applied CSS styling to dynamic components
- Debugged undefined errors caused by missing exports

Day-7:
### React Module – Mapping Components & Props

Completed:
- Used Array.map() to dynamically render components
- Passed data as props to reusable components
- Separated UI into clean, reusable React components
- Rendered structured data from an external JS file
- Improved component readability and scalability

Day-8:
### JavaScript Array Methods & String Handling

Completed:
- Learned map() to transform each item in an array into a new value
- Practiced filter() to create arrays based on true/false conditions
- Understood reduce() for accumulating values into a single result
- Used find() to get the first matching element from an array
- Used findIndex() to get the index of the first matching element
- Applied substring() to extract specific portions of a string
- Gained clarity on operating at the correct level: array → item → property → string

Day-9:
### JavaScript ES6 Arrow Functions

Completed:
- Learned ES6 arrow function syntax for cleaner and shorter function definitions
- Converted traditional functions into arrow functions
- Practiced arrow functions with single and multiple parameters
- Used implicit return for single-expression functions
- Applied arrow functions as callbacks inside array methods
- Improved code readability and reduced boilerplate code

Day-10:
### React – Mapping Components & Dynamic Rendering (Keeper App Part 2)

Completed:
- Used Array.map() to render multiple React components dynamically
- Passed data from a separate file (notes.js) into components via props
- Rendered reusable Note components instead of hardcoding UI
- Applied the key prop correctly while mapping components
- Improved component structure by separating data and UI logic
- Strengthened understanding of parent-to-child data flow in React
- Built a scalable notes UI similar to Google Keep

Day-11:
### React Conditional Rendering

Completed:
- Practiced conditional rendering in React using:
- Ternary operator (condition ? A : B)
- Logical AND operator (condition && A)
- Controlled UI rendering based on application state
- Passed state as props to child components
- Dynamically changed button text and form fields
- Improved understanding of when to use ternary vs AND rendering
- Built a clean, minimal practice project to reinforce concepts

Key Takeaway:
Conditional rendering allows React apps to stay dynamic and responsive without unnecessary components or routes.
